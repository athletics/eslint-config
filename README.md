# eslint-config-athletics

This configuration is designed to be used with ESLint. In order to use it in your project, first install the npm module:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-athletics
```

That will add the configuration to your `package.json`. From there, extend the ESLint ruleset by adding this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```js
"extends": "athletics"
```
